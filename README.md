# Time Crash

In a post-apocalyptic Earth, you must reach the origin point of the catastrophe to turn off the lab experiment responsible for all the destruction - but you must face elements out-of-time to reach it, like velociraptors (with feathers, since this is a scientific acurate game), and Napoleon's soldiers.

_Earth cannot survive a Time Crash. You have 30 seconds!_

## About

The project uses Phaser CE 2.91, and was mainly used for self-learning about game dev.

The objective now is to evolve the project with more features and levels.

## Installation

Since this project uses Daniel Belohlavek's Phaser ES6 Boilerplate[es6], the installation instructions are the same as [his][1].

You need [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/). You should also have git installed, but it's not mandatory.

Clone the repository (or download the ZIP file)

`git clone https://github.com/danielklava/time-crash.git`

Install dependencies by running npm

`npm install`

From there you can run either a development build or a production build:
* Development build:
  `npm start`

* Production build:
  `npm run production`

Any modification to the files inside the `./src` and `./static` folder will trigger a full page reload.

If you modify the contents of other files, please manually restart the server.
